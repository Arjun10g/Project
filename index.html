        <p>The dataset consists of 1071 observations and 35 variables with variables 1-32 comprising of information from the 32 items in the Questionnaire. The next two variables contained demographic information about gender and age. The final variable was a self report item on an individual's percieved accuray of the answers on the Questionnaire. </p>

        <p>The final step with regards to <span style = "font-family: Poppins;"> <b>EFA</b></span> analysis involved finding an interpretable solution for the factor loadings. In order to achieve this we rotated our factor solution using Oblimin rotation. </p>

        <p>The decision to choose the gamma weight for the oblimin rotation is highly arbitary. Since our intended goal was to maximize row and column parsimony, we chose to automate this procedure. 56 different values of gamma were used to estimate average item complexities for each model. We discovered that a gamma of <b>0.2</b> led to the lowest item complexity. </p>

Furthermore, item 6 and item 28 were removed due to low factor loadings.

        <p>We performed Multiple Group Analysis across Gender and Age to evaluate measurement invariance. The goal was to evaluate whether or not, under different conditions of observing and studying phenomena, measurements yield measures of the
same attributes. We modelled the mean structure by including intercepts in the original model. Since invariance involves a hierarchy of models, testing for invariance required a multi-step
procedure, testing more restrictive models at each step. The four conditions were as follows - </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Configural Invariance (No Restrictions)</li>
            <li>Weak Invariance (Constrained Factor Loadings)</li>

            <li>Strict Invariance (Constrained Factor Loadings, Intercepts and Variances)</li>

        <h2 class="small">Data</h2>
        <p class="cent"> <b style = "color:black">Martin et. al (2003)</b> : A subset of the data was selected for a PCA (n=485), PCA was
            cross-validated on another subset of participants (n= 452). CFA was conducted on all
            participant data (n=1195).
        </p>
        <p class="cent"><b style = "color:black">Current Analysis</b>: Data was randomly split for EFA (n=497) and CFA (n=496) and cleaned to
            remove missing values.</p>

        <h2 class="small">Factor Retention</h2>
        <p class="cent"><b style = "color:black">Martin et. al (2003)</b>: PCA using Varimax rotation was computed on 32 items. Examination of
            the scree plots, eigenvalues and factor loadings was used to make a decision that a 4-factor
            solution was optimal.</p>
        <p class="cent"><b style = "color:black">Current Analysis</b>: Analysis: EFA on the 32 items was used to determine the factor structure using
            oblimin rotation, while selecting a gamma value that reduced item complexity the most.
            Decisions were made based on converging evidence: Revised Parallel Analysis,
            Comparison Data Approach, EKC, Sequential Model Testing.</p>
        <p><b><u>Here, we decided to use a four-factor model, although a 5-factor model had slightly
            better fit indices. This is different from what was previously reported by the authors.</u></b></p>

        <h2 class="small">CFA</h2>
        <p class="cent"><b style = "color:black">Martin et. al (2003)</b>: A four-factor model was tested, with the four scales as latent variables and eight items as
            indicators for each latent variable. Measurement error was assumed to be uncorrelated
            between items, while the four latent variables were allowed to covary. It was concluded that the model was a good fit of the data: “The results indicated a good fit
            to the data (CMIN/DF=3.37, GFI=.91, AGFI=.90, RMSEA=.048).”
            The Affiliative humor latent variable had a covariance of .34 with Self-enhancing humor, and
            the covariance between the Aggressive and Self-defeating humor latent variables was .36.
            Nonetheless, a higher order model was not explored. </p>

        <p class="cent"><b style = "color:black">Current Analysis</b>: 28 items were selected for CFA. Decisions to remove items were made
            based on communalties, local independence violations, factor loadings and conceptual theory. With the exception of excluded items (6, 25 ,28 & 30), the same set of items loaded into the
            4 latent variables describing the humor types. Affiliative and Self-enhancing humor loaded
            significantly onto Positive humor, whereas Aggressive and Self-defeating humor loaded
            significantly onto Negative humor. </p>

        <p><b><u>We have shown that a higher order model describes the data well, but we found
            issues with model fit due to non-independence between questionnaire items. This
            was not previously described.</u></b></p>

        <h2 class="small">Group Invariance</h2>
        <p class="cent"><b style = "color:black">Martin et. al (2003)</b>: Group differences were analysed by performing an ANOVA and t-tests
            for pairwise comparisons, on composite scores (the sum of the items the load into each
            humor type). The whole data was used for analysis (n=1195). The authors reported
            differences due to both sex and age. </p>
        <p class="cent"><b style = "color:black">Current Analysis</b>: We performed a multiple group analysis. And discovered that there were
            no notable differences in the dataset (n=496) across gender and age. </p>
